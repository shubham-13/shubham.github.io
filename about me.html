		<div class="about">
			<p>
			The journey of my life began on 1st of Februrary 1996.T hat was the day I was blessed upon my parents and after a while was given the name <b>Shubham Singhal</b>. Well my life's been great ever since the day (ofcourse excepts some bumps that everyone gets). Being the elder brother, I faced nothing such as torture of an elder sibling rather I was the one doing it. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Well I had almost everything one could wish for. A great family, a nice and comfortable life and the best friends.Because we were tenants initially, we had to move a lot. And still every place I went, I somehow managed to find some great people who till day are my best friends. 
			</p>
			<p>
			I am not an extrovert. I prefer to live in my own world. I spent most of my childhood time either studying or playing Cricket.I was always the topper of of my class so studies was not much of a problem. And it was just me who had a real cricket bat, it was me who always batted first. Those were really great times.
			</p>
			<p>
			The three most important things in my life are my family, my friends and my passion.Though I have not yet found out the one true passion of mine but still what I do i always try to give my best on it. And I will go to any heights or depths to do whatever I can for these three things.	
			</p>
			<p>
			Well that was all about myself in a nut-shell ! <br/><br/>
