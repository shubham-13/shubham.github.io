		I dont have much to write here. That's because I gain interest in whatever I do. SO there's not much that I like do to specifically. But still some things are worth mentioning.
		</p>
		<dl>
		    <dt>Guitar</dt>
		        <dd>I love to play guitar. I am still learning but yes I do find it fascinating and the best thing to do while I am free.</dd>
		    <dt>Table Tennis</dt>
		        <dd>I am a decent Table Tennis player. Well this is one of the rare things I learnt at school.</dd>

			<dt>Tennis</dt>
		  	<dd>I am a die hard fan of Rafael Nadal since the year he defeated the defending champion Roger Federar in Wimbledon. Though I have not even handled a tennis racket in my hand before but I love to watch it.</dd>
			<dt>Writing</dt>
		  	<dd>I like to write when I am flooded with emotions. Whether I am too happy or too sad, too excited or too nervous, I feel that writing about it helps to increase the level of happiness, excitement etc. and it certainly decreases the level of sadness.</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>
		That's all. Not much as I said !
