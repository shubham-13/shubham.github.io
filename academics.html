			<p>
			Education is one of the most important aspects in my life. I worked my hardest during my school time so that I can be a successful man. It wouldn't be wrong to say that almost during whole of my school life all I did was study. I feel as though my education is what keeps me on the right track. I have always loved studies unlike most people.

			I did most of my schooling from Saint Anselm's School. It's a convent school in Jaipur itself. It may seem like I am flaunting but yes I was one of the few popular students of the school. I had a great time there. I passes my 12th grade in the Science+Maths stream with 95% score.
			</p>
			<p>
			I cleared the Joint Entrance Exam for IIT's and was selected for IIT Kharagpur, the oldest IIT in INDIA. Well no doubt about the saying "Old is Gold". It is worth calling it to be one of the finest colleges in India. And I am proud to be a KGPian. I am in for a 4 year B.Tech course in Metallurgical and Material Sciences.
