		The first thing that comes to mind seeing this word "Aspirations" is that I want to go to Paris some day. It's got no reason behind it. Just a childhood wish that is intact till now. And I am gonna go to Paris someday. I am quite sure of that. I'll work for it whatever I can.
		</p>
		<p>
		As everyone I want to be a successful person achieve what a deserve. In Future I see myself not with much pomp and show but with a decent 9 to 5 job with a handsome salary and a partner to share it with.
		</p>
		<p>
		That's all I really want from my life. Rest all is fantasy. Not so important.
